// If a type has the Copy trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment
// - All the integer types, such as u32
// - The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false
// - All the floating point types, such as f64
// - The character type, char
// - Tuples, if they only contain types that are also Copy
//   For example, (i32, i32) is Copy, but (i32, String) is not
